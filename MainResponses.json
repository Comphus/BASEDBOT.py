		"!vladme":"because a lot of the girls are forgettable as fuck. There's a reason she has SO many fans and supporters. She's working her ass off and has a very positive, charming aura about her. Despite being emberassed in front of everyone, she never once cried in a negative light (only cries after she overcomes achievements). To improve from absolute garbage to completely average in one night (having no prior dancing expirience) is such an admirable feat. She's a magnet for GENUINE positive energy and affection. At the end of the day, being an idol is all about personality. There are TONS of groups who excel at dancing and singing but FLOP hardcore due to no presence and/or not having lovable characteristics.(edited) You have to remember that Korea MASS produces \"talent\" that turns these girls into psuedo humans (robots). Giving off such a genuine aura is what fans kill to see when it comes to Kpop groups Exactly why the toughest trainer who hasn't shown affection to ANYONE throughout the whole show fucking BALLED her damn eyes out seeing how genuine and hardworking Sohye is. If she can bring those emotions to someone that hardboiled, image how many fans' hearts she has captured; hence contributing a huge part to the group's success. She's 100% landing a spot in the top 11, if not top 6(edited) There's this one girl group called Spica that is arguably the most talented girl group in Kpop, every single girl in that group has a HEAVENLY voice, but yet they hardcore flop because there's no charisma to go with it. Talent by itself simply doesn't sell in Korea",
